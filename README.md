# learn_python_with_tests

Code for teaching Python.

First Project ideas came from Invent with Python.

- [Guess Number](src/guess_new_number.py)
- [Hangman](src/hangman.py)
- [Wordle](src/wordle.py) (instead of Bagels)
- [tic tac toe](src/tic_tac_toe/)
    Reasonably over engineered version for the command line.

Some examples of Python code illustrated by tests at [examples](tests/examples/README.md)
